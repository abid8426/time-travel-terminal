# time-travel-terminal
A Time-Traveling Terminal could be  useful for debugging historical system states or predicting system behavior based on predefined conditions.
# 🕰️ Time-Traveling Terminal

**Time-Traveling Terminal** is a custom Python-based virtual terminal that simulates the behavior of past and future operating system states. This tool is ideal for debugging historical states, experimenting with future scenarios, and managing system snapshots—all within a controlled, educational, and futuristic environment.

# 🌟 Features

🔹 **Historical Mode**  
Simulate an operating system environment from a specific year (e.g., 1995, 2005).  
Observe older file structures, legacy commands, or software behavior.

🔹 **Future Mode**  
Simulate future environments (e.g., 2030) using AI-based or rule-based predictions.  
Understand what changes might happen in commands or file systems.

🔹 **Snapshot-Based Execution**  
Take and restore system snapshots.  
Test your system behavior in different "time states".

🔹 **Rollback & Fast-Forward**  
Navigate forward and backward through system states like a timeline.  
Supports both manual and command-line control.

🔹 **Custom Commands**  
Custom-built commands like `travel`, `predict`, `restore`, `touch`, and `read`  
All commands work inside the virtual terminal without relying on your real OS.
